    <h1>Your room is running!</h1>

    <p>Consider this your primitive health check, well done!</p>

    <p>Your websocket endpoint is ws://localhost:9080/room. Use browser
        extensions to play with the WebSocket running locally.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://gameontext.gitbooks.io/gameon-gitbook/content/microservices/WebsocketProtocol.html">WebSocket protocol</a>
        used by Game On! is documented in the <a href="https://gameontext.gitbooks.io/gameon-gitbook/content/">book</a>.</p>

    <p>Standing up this initial room was pretty easy, right?</p>

    <p>
        So, what happens if you want to make this scale? How will the
        Map service find and connect to the instances of your service?
    </p><p>
        Each room instance uses WebSockets to broadcast events and
        chat to connected players. What happens when you have multiple
        instances of your room? Do you want all of them to behave as
        a single room (such that all events are visible in all rooms),
        or is each an independent/transient sharded instance?
    </p><p>
        Want to try adding items? How do you track the state of those
        items. In memory? In a shared cache? ...
